Project Overview:

Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a chat system on the Internet. It is a text-based chat (instant messaging) system. IRC is generally designed for group communication in discussion forums, called channels, but also allows one-on-one communication via private messages as well as chat and data transfer, including file sharing.

This project implements features like - connecting clients with servers, creating a chat room for communication between individuals/in groups, joining a channel, leaving the channel, switching between rooms, listing members of room, disconnecting from server, message handler that guides user for next actions like join, leave, list of rooms and many more.

Our motive is to learn and implement as many features as possible to accomplish a good project which can be useful for a great communication between clients and servers.
